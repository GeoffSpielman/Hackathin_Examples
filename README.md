# Hackathin_Examples

This repository contains all of the sample code and accompanying PowerPoints for ‘The Hackathin’, a small scale hackthon I prepared and led for a living and learning community of first year engineering students. It’s called ‘the hackathin’ since it was far shorter than most hackathons and was meant to be the student’s first hackathon. As such it featured several in depth workshops which covered setting up and using an Arduino, buttons and LEDs, button debouncing, using PWM for LED brightness, Serial communication between the Pi and the Arduino, and a few other things. On the software side I covered installing and using Python, I provided a refresher/intro to Python syntax, I went over installing and using the PyGame library and discussed sprites from the PyGame library including an example of their application.

The idea was attendees could start with the Arduino, build a controller or whatever interface they wanted, and then code a game using it. I recommended using the Arduino Leonardo (see the recommended hardware package) since it allows the user to mimic keyboard and mouse input to their computer, but the Uno works as well.

I had to break the PowerPoints up into smaller pieces since they were exceeding file size limits so I recommend going through them in this order:

* Hardware_Introduction_Workshop_1
* Hardware_Introduction_Workshop_2
* Hardware_Introduction_Workshop_3
* Hardware_Intermediate_Workshop_1
* Hardware_Intermediate_Workshop_2
* Hardware_Intermediate_Workshop_3
* Software_Introduction_Workshop
* Software_Intermediate_Workshop
